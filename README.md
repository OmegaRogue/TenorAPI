# TenorSharp
TenorSharp is a C# Library for the [TenorAPI](https://tenor.com/gifapi). TenorSharp was made with dotNET Core 2.1

TenorSharp can be used to retrieve Content from Tenor without directly interfacing with the Tenor REST API.

Refer to the [Tenor API Attribution Guidelines](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation#attribution) to properly attribute Content retrieved from Tenor.

To get started, install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TenorSharp/1.0.0) in your Project.

If you need more help, refer to the Documentation in IntelliSense.
